    p <strong><em>Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns</em></strong> is a North American Quaker faith community that affirms that of God in all people. Gathering twice yearly for worship and play, we draw sustenance from each other and from the Spirit for our work and life in the world. We are learning that radical inclusion and radical love bring further light to Quaker testimony and life. <a href='/about'>[More]</a>

      h1 Outreach and Resources
      p We have an active email list, for all who have come to our Gatherings. Contact the <a href="mailto:email_list_manager@flgbtqc.org">Email List Manager</a> for more information.
      p Our newsletter is published roughly three times a year. It is received by 900 individuals and Meetings worldwide.
      p We have produced a pamphlet about FLGBTQC and our work in the world.
      p We are collecting Marriage Minutes written by Quaker Meetings affirming same-sex Quaker marriages and other commitment ceremonies.  If your Meeting has minuted support for same-sex Quaker marriages but you are not included on this list, please contact the <a class="content" href="remailer.cgi?role=Terry">Web Site Manager</a>. These minutes have been included in amicus briefs for several court cases.  We try to keep them as up-to-date as possible.
      p We are collecting Minutes that specifically welcome and affirm transgender people on a new page on our web site.  We ask that minutes included on this page be <strong>primarily concerned with transgender inclusion</strong>.  We are also collecting minutes that more generally affirm lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people and will be including a new page on our site for those affirmations.  Please contact the <a href="mailto:clerks@flgbtqc.org">Clerks</a> for more information.
