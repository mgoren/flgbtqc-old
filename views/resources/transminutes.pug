    h6 Adelphi Friends Meeting <span class='close hidden'>x</span>
    p Minute Welcoming Transgender Persons
    p Approved January 13, 2013
    p Adelphi Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends understands that God, who loves all people unconditionally, is leading the Meeting to honor the gender identity of each person, as that person determines it.
    p In addition to welcoming transgender persons to worship with us, in 2009 our Meeting supported a Friend and her family through her gender transition as she claimed her wholeness as a woman. Our testimonies of equality and community confirm that when we embrace that of God in everyone, including the full spectrum of gender identities in our Meeting, our worship deepens and our community is enriched.
    p Every person should be able to live out fully what the Spirit is leading them to be. Adelphi will be an affirming, safe, and nurturing place for everyone. We extend our loving care to all transgender persons, and their families and friends, who seek to share our Quaker spiritual journey and corporate life.

    h6 Athens Friends Meeting <span class='close hidden'>x</span>
    p November 2018
    p Athens Friends Meeting affirms that our Meeting has been gifted beyond measure by the presence, participation and Spirit-guided leadership of LGBTQ Friends. We want to say to all who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer that we stand together. Friends believe that we are all equal before God, and there is that of God in each of us. We aspire to be a safe and loving space and extend our loving care to all who come as seekers to share in worship and the life of our meeting. All are invited to attend and, if so led, to request membership. Membership includes the privilege of marriage under the care of the Meeting.
    p The Athens Friends Meeting is part of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). From the Society’s beginnings in the 1600’s, Friends have sought a religious experience that is personal – free from doctrinal creeds, and from institutional hierarchy. For Friends, religion is more than believing: it leads to acting in the world in the spirit of love. Friends recognize that religious understandings are not static, but that they grow deeper over time and with experience.

    h6 Atlanta Friends Meeting <span class='close hidden'>x</span>
    p April 2005
    p As a community of faith, we [the Atlanta Friends Meeting] have become aware of the many ways in which lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and queer people have been silenced and excluded. We will never go back to silencing these voices among us, or suppressing these gifts, for in so doing, we impoverish our whole community. Our experience has been that Spiritual gifts are not distributed with regard to sexual orientation or gender identity. Our experience has been that the life of our Meeting and its work have been immeasurably enriched over the years by the full participation and Spirit-guided leadership of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer Friends. Full participation includes encouragement in ministry and positions of leadership, ability to be married under the care of the Meeting, and nurture to all families. We therefore explicitly celebrate the participation of LGBTQ Friends in these, as in all other aspects of the life of the Meeting. Our experience confirms that we are all equal before God, as God made us, and we feel blessed to be engaged in community and religious life together.

    p Northside Friends is a diverse community. All are welcome among us. Families of all sorts, single parents, youth and elders, people of all races and orientations may participate in our worship. As diverse as we are demographically, we are as diverse theologically as well. Friends come from a wide variety of faith traditions and histories. Instead of finding our diversity troubling, it is for us a cause for spiritual celebration and intellectual challenge; there is no impediment here to genuine worship, spiritual seeking and finding.

In the 1980's we supported our members through the AIDS crisis, in 1989 we celebrated our first lesbian marriage, and Friends of our Meeting with our support have twice organized the annual North American Mid-Winter Gathering of Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns.
